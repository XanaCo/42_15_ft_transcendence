## Overview

The `ft_transcendence` project is the final step in the 42 curriculum, requiring students to build a **full-stack web application** with real-time functionalities. The project aims to create a **multiplayer Pong game** with **authentication, user management, chat and game matchmaking**, following modern web development standards.

This project emphasizes security, scalability and maintainability while integrating various technologies, including **Django, Bootstrap, WebSockets, PostgreSQL and Docker**.

## Key Components

1. **Web**: Uses Django as the backend framework, Bootstrap for frontend design and PostgreSQL as the database.
2. **User Management**: Implements standard authentication, user profiles and user tracking across tournaments.
3. **Gameplay and User Experience**: Supports remote multiplayer gameplay, a matchmaking system with user history, customizable game settings and live chat. A second minigame is included, styled as a pokemon map, with similar user management as the pong main game.
4. **AI & Algorithms**: Provides user and game statistics dashboards for tracking performance.
5. **Cybersecurity**: Implements WAF/ModSecurity with hardened configurations, HashiCorp Vault for secrets management, GDPR compliance with user anonymization and account deletion and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using JWT.
6. **DevOps**: Backend is designed as microservices and containerized with Docker for scalability and maintainability.
7. **Graphics**: Utilizes advanced 3D techniques with WebGL and Three.js to enhance game visuals.
8. **Accessibility**: Ensures support across multiple devices and expands browser compatibility for an inclusive experience.
9. **Server-Side Pong**: Replaces traditional Pong with a server-side implementation and provides an API for gameplay interactions.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **Full-Stack Development**: Mastering both backend (Django, PostgreSQL) and frontend (Bootstrap, WebSockets).
2. **User Management & Authentication**: Implementing secure login, session handling and cross-tournament user tracking.
3. **Game Development**: Enhancing user engagement with customizable settings, history-based matchmaking and real-time communication.
4. **AI & Data Analysis**: Creating dashboards for user and game statistics to track and improve gameplay.
5. **Cybersecurity & Compliance**: Strengthening security with WAF, secrets management and ensuring GDPR compliance.
6. **Microservices & DevOps**: Designing and deploying scalable services using Docker.
7. **Advanced Graphics**: Leveraging WebGL and Three.js to provide a visually immersive experience.
8. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Ensuring compatibility with multiple devices and browsers.
9. **API Development**: Building and securing APIs for server-side Pong gameplay.
